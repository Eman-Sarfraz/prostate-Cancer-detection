# 🧠 Prostate Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning Models

This repository presents a comparative study of multiple deep learning architectures applied to prostate cancer detection and classification. I trained, tested, and analyzed models including **ResNet**, **ConvNet**, **EfficientNet**, and **DenseNet**, evaluating their performance using various metrics and visual analytics.


## 🧪 Models Trained

| Model         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🌀 ResNet      | Residual learning for deep neural networks (ResNet-50) |
| 🔳 ConvNet     | Custom Convolutional Neural Network (baseline) |
| ⚡ EfficientNet | Scalable and lightweight architecture (EfficientNet-B0/B3) |
| 🌱 DenseNet    | Dense connections for improved gradient flow (DenseNet-121) |
